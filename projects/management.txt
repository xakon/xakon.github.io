Project Management
==================

Most common Agile methods are Scrum and Kanban.  Here is a list of available
software tools for them.

Kanban
------

I find https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)[Kanban] as more
suitable for small teams and projects.

There are plenty of free-to-use tools:

=== Cloud ===

 - https://gitkraken.com/[GitKraken Glo]
 - https://gitlab.com/[Gitlab]
 - https://github.com/[Github]

=== Local ===

 - https://github.com/greggigon/my-personal-kanban[My Personal Kanban]:
   A single-page Kanban application, which can run locally.


Scrum
-----

The leading software tool for
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)[Scrum]
is without any doubt https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira[Jira].
A minimal alternative is https://pace.dev[Pace], where we can do
much less than Jira, but much faster.

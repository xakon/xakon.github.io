 - Bash function to output text from [Developer Excuses](http://developerexcuses.com).

 - Git plugin to move working directory forward, starting from initial commit:
   * find out initial commit			# git show-log --reverse --children
   * find out how Git outputs [master~25]
   * $ git myplugin --start	# checkout initial commit
   * $ git myplugin --continue	# checkout next commit in future
   * $ git myplugin --abort	# restore workdir before starting operation

 - Find information about web API of "Read it Later" service.
   I need it to get article list, edit article titles, query article archive.

 - Create my own "Read Articles" archive list, add API to query it over HTTP.

 * Find out (at last!) how I can efficiently test cmdline arguments with Python unit tests.
   If there's nothing available, study code of `mercurial` or other, cmdline-oriented projects.

   The solution seems to be `cram`, a tool that uses `mercurial`'s unified tests for its
   cmdline suite.

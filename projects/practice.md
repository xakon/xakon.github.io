Craftsmanship Practices
=======================

In general, I don't believe in *Katas* or in *Dojos*.
After reading, though, Robert C. (Uncle Bob) Martin's opinion that
a *Craftman* should always exercise and improve his skills through
continuous practice, I have to reconsider my mind.

In any case, here are some collection of resources:

 - <http://codingdojo.org/>
 - <http://codingdojo.org/kata/>
 - <https://cyber-dojo.org/>
 - [Photohackers](https://protohackers.com/):
   Write network servers to implement network protocols as exercises.

Microsoft also hosts an online course,
[Web Developers for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners),
which could be used to develop more my JavaScript skills.
It is a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, and HTTML/CSS basics.

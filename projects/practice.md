Craftsmanship Practices
=======================

In general, I don't believe in *Katas* or in *Dojos*.
After reading, though, Robert C. (Uncle Bob) Martin's opinion that
a *Craftman* should always exercise and improve his skills through
continuous practice, I have to reconsider my mind.

In any case, here are some collection of resources:

 - <http://codingdojo.org/>
 - <http://codingdojo.org/kata/>
 - <https://cyber-dojo.org/>
 - [Photohackers](https://protohackers.com/):
   Write network servers to implement network protocols as exercises.

Microsoft also hosts an online course,
[Web Developers for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners),
which could be used to develop more my JavaScript skills.
It is a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, and HTTML/CSS basics.

For larger projects, [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) is a nice
community:  it lets you write some large projects, but in a controlled fashion,
where each project needs to be finished in stages, from easy to difficult.
They support many different programming languages.
There is Github integration, solutions, guidance, and more.
Unfortunately, it's a bit expensive, so it needs a monthly dedication, at least.

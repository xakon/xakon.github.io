DNS Server
==========

A simple DNS server written in [Go][go] or [C++][cpp] or any other
low-level, system language.

My purpose is to study a network protocol, DNS in this case, by implementing a
simple server in a new language.  This way, I will exercise my skills in this
language, but also learn interesting and funny things about network protocols.

There is an internet guy, [Paul Heinlein][paul] that supplies some information
about DNS, dig and bind.  It is always useful to use his articles for
reference, examples, and/or implementation details.

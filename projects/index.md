Projects
========

A list of project ideas and notes about them for future reference.

A draft list of project ideas:

 - [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop):
   Implement this nice program in another language, certainly not in JavaScript!

 - [Blog](blog.html)

 - Integration Server:
   Define repositories, branches and check every single commit (by running some
   specified commands), automatically, on every branch change.  Notify user
   using email or other means.


 - [DNS Server](dns_server.html)

 - Create a simple Web Site using NGINX, at least to host some photos,
   and play with HTTPS and HTTP/2.  It's not going to be anything serious!

 - Build a Hackintosh!
   Why not?  It's also a nice and cheaper experience than having to buy a iMac.

 - A Blogging platform serving static content.
   I will need two different domains, one for administration (authors), one for readers.
   Use NGINX for static content.  Let authors decide on underlying format.
   Support Markdown, Asciidoc, reStructuredText.  Keep full history of articles
   and photos, don't let anybody accidentally delete them.  Call it epikara.tk
   and let authors write blog posts or longer articles (skepseis).  An
   article/post once posted is immutable, but before posting it, it should
   become a draft.  The author should be able to check all the versions of the
   article.

 - Use a monitor tool for all the machines.  A nice idea comes from this
   [article](http://reachtim.com/articles/psutil-and-mongodb-for-system-monitoring.html).
   Adapt it to my needs and requirements and use it from a central point.
   For example, have CEID collect or redirect data to every host I manage.

 - Study [Perl](perl.org) and try to hack it.

 - Play with vimcat.

 - Write a Scheme/Lisp implementation using some examples:

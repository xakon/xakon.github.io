Games
=====

At <http://archive.org> there is a huge collection of [MS-DOS Games][dos-games].
Also, at [Games Nostalgia](https://gamesnostalgia.com/), I can find the actual
games from the past!

Some retro games (like for Amstrad CPC or Amiga) need an emulator to be played.
There are literally thousands of them.  A GitHub project,
[Awesome Emulators](https://github.com/DerekTurtleRoe/awesome-emulators), has a
full list of many of them.  Of course, we can also use
[MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) in order to play old games for obsolete
machines.

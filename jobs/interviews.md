Interviews
==========

Interviews for a job position is one of the most stressful things for me.
There are many nice tips for them, but the stress always remains the same.

Of course, during an interview, it's the only time I have to learn about the
company.  So, I always ask a lot of questions to the peers, showing also that I
am interested for the company and the position, but I don't take it lightly such
a decision.

[Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/), one of the Django authors, has a
nice series of articles, where he works on each important aspect of the
interview.  It is highly recommended to be read at least once, but also as a
consulting material before major interviews.  The series can be found at:

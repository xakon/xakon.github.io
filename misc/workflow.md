Pomodoro
--------

Pomodoro is a nice workflow technique, based on scheduled pauses and no
intermediate interruptions, in order to keep with the "flow".

Here is a list of some Pomodoro applications for Linux:

1. Pomodoro
   GNOME Shell extension.
2. Pomidor
   Paid application for Gnome3.
3. Gnome Clocks
   GNOME's dedicated clock application.  It features some timers, which
   can be used to track down the Pomodoro schedules.
4. Tomato.es
   Web application.  Maybe the best Pomodoro application.
5. Zeegaree Lite
   A timer application that can be used to instantiate the Pomodoro techinque.

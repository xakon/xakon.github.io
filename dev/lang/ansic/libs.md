Libraries
=========

A point where ANSI C lacks behind other popular languages is with its standard library.
Although ANSI Standard Library is an excellent software from design perspective,
still it's minimal and we need to use many other libraries to accomplish our goals,
quickly and easily.

Here is a list of industry-based, strong-supported libraries:


### General Frameworks ###

 - [APR](https://github.com/apache/apr):
   Apache Portable Runtime Library.


### Profiling ###

 - [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/):
   Creation of interactive flamegraphs out of a profile file.


### XML ###

 - [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/):
   The XML C parser and toolkit for Gnome

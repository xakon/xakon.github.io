References
==========

Some great articles I read in the past about Go, and I need to save them for
future reference.  Of course, I also need a tagging mechanism to easily identify
and locate them.


[Your Basic Go](http://yourbasic.org/golang/) contains short guides, nutshells,
tutorials, cheat-sheets, and more plenty material, in a very concise way.

### Built-in Functions

They are defined in the `erlang` module and described in the BIFs manual.
In general, they modify the behaviour of the system and they perform tasks
that cannot be done (or is difficult to) in Erlang.

Here is a short list of them:

 - length()		-- return the length of a list
 - size()		-- return the size of a tuple
 - atom_to_list()	-- create a list with the characters of the atom
 - integer_to_list()	-- convert an integer to a string
 - list_to_tuple()
 - date()		-- return system's current date
 - time()		-- return system's current time

 - io:format/2

### Guards

*Guards* can appear in a function clause.
They are introduced with the `when` keyword.
They can't be user-defined functions.
All variables in a guard must be bound.

A simple list of guards (more can be found in User's Guide):

 - number(X)
 - integer(X)
 - float(X)
 - atom(X)
 - tuple(X)
 - list(X)

 - length(X) == 3
 - size(X) == 2

 - X > Y + Z
 - X == Y
 - X =:= Y

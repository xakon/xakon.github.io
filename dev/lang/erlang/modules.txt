Modules
-------

*Modules* help to organize code.  So, place relevant functions in the same module.
Modules have on the top a couple of attributes (metadata).
Some of them are:  +module+, +export+, +import+, +author+, and others.
You can see these metadata using the +module_info/0+, provided by the compiler.

An Erlang's module must start with a +-module().+ statement,
supplying the module's name to the system, and then with the +-export().+ statement,
that declares all symbols exported by this module.  Any symbol not exported by
a module can't be used outside of it.

During the declaration of the exported symbols, we need to specify the required
arguments of that symbol.  For example, the statement

```erlang
-export([mult/2, double/1]).
```

will export a +mult+ function that accepts 2 arguments and a +double+ function
that accepts only one argument.

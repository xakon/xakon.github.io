Examples of x86 Assembly
========================

### SectorLISP ###

The [SectorLISP](https://justine.lol/sectorlisp/) implements a minimum LISP
environment that can fit in the boot sector of a floppy (512 bytes).

The project is a great example of writing LISP code, but also x86 assembly,
optimized C code, a TUI emulator, with instructions to run it either with QEMU
or with a PC emulator, [Blinkenlights](https://justine.lol/blinkenlights/).

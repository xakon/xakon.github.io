MOS Technology 6502
===================

A popular 8-bit CPU used extensively in old, micro computers.
A predecessor of _Motorola 6800_ and, by extension, to _Motorola 68000_.

A very simple architecture, ideal for teaching assembly programming.
It's CMOS version, the _WDC 65C02_, is still used in embedded systems.

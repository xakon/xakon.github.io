Zilog Z80
=========

Unfortunately, Zilog just announced that it is going to discontinue the production of the [Z80]
microprocessor.

A popular 8-bit processor from the '80s, it still finds many uses in embedded programming,
especially for hobby projects.  It's architecture and assembly looks a lot like Intel's x86.

We have more popular processors from the same series, namely the [Zilog eZ80](eZ80), which is a
faster version of the [Z80], and [Zilog Z180][Z180], which is also an 8-bit processor, but supports
many a 16-bit operations.

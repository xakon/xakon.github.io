Notes

Some notes about the architecture of the 80x86 processors.


### 8086 ###

It has 16 registers, all of them 16-bit:

 - General:	`AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`
 - Index:	`SI`, `DI`, `BP`, `SP`
 - Segment:	`CS`, `DS`, `ES`, `SS`
 - PC:		`IP`
 - Status:


The _General Registers_ can be accessed as 8-bit registers as well, like this:

    (AH, AL), (BH, BL), (CH, CL), (DH, DL)

The _8088_ was a clone of _8086_, but was connected with an 8-bit BUS to memory.


### 80286 ###


### 80386 ###

There were 2 main models, the _386SX_ and the _386DX_.

It has 16 registers, most of them 32-bit:

 - Main:	`EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`
 - Index:	`ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP`, `ESP`
 - Segment:	`CS`, `DS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`, `SS`
 - PC:		`EIP`
 - Status:

Notes about the syntax and the semantics of the language.


Objects
=======

_Objects_ in JavaScript can be created in 3 ways:

 - Object literal syntax (similar to Python `dict`)
 - Object constructor (similar to Java's syntax of creating objects)
 - Function constructor, conventionally these functions are CamelCase written
   (mimic a constructor by using low-level JavaScript primitives)
 - Class definition

More commonly, _objects_ are created with the help of a creational builder and
factory Design Pattern.

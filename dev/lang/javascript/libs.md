Libraries
=========

A short list of useful JavaScript libraries that I can use in projects.

JavaScript's library ecosystem is vast, backed by the [NPM] registry.
As there are literally thousands of [NPM] packages, I will document here only
the ones that I find really necessary and useful for my needs.

Networking
----------

 - [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios):
   Promise-based HTTP client for the Browser and Node.js.
   The recommended HTTP client to be used instead of the
   [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.

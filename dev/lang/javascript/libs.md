Libraries
=========

A short list of useful JavaScript libraries that I can use in projects.

JavaScript's library ecosystem is vast, backed by the [NPM] registry.
As there are literally thousands of [NPM] packages, I will document here only
the ones that I find really necessary and useful for my needs.

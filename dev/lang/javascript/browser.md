Browser
=======

JavaScript running on browsers have a different environment.
Most notable, the `Console` object.  Here are some interesting methods:

 - `log()`, `info()`, `warn()`, `error()`
 - `table()`
 - `group()`, `endGroup()`
 - `count()`, `time()`, `endTime()`
 - `assert()`, `trace()`

Chrome DevTools (and probably Firefox as well) have an enormous amount of tools
to assist on Web development.  They even allow users to extend them by
installing extensions, or even write custom extensions for them.  The official
documentation can be found at [Chrome DevTools][chrome-devtools], together with
plenty of guides.

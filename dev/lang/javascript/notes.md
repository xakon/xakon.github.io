General Notes
=============

Similar to CSS, JavaScript code can be included embedded in an HTML page using
the `<script>` element (again inside the `<head>` element), or referenced
externally using the `<link>` tag.

The most popular JavaScript engines are:

 - [SpiderMonkey][spidermonkey] (Mozilla Firefox)
 - [Chrome V8][chrome-v8] (Google Chrome, Node.js)
 - [Chakra][chakra] (MS Explorer, MS Edge)
 - [JavaScriptCore][js-core] (Apple Safari)

LISP Examples
=============

### SectorLISP ###

The temptation to write a LISP with LISP is high.
The [SectorLISP](https://justine.lol/sectorlisp/) goes one step further, and
implements a minimum LISP environment that can fit in the boot sector of a
floppy (512 bytes).

The project is a great example of writing LISP code, but also x86 assembly,
optimized C code, a TUI emulator, with instructions to run it either with QEMU
or with a PC emulator, [Blinkenlights](https://justine.lol/blinkenlights/).

In general, it is a treasure of many different aspects in CS.

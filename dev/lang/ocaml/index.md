OCaml
=====

[OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) is another descendant from the ML
family of programming languages.  It added a couple of extra features to the
[Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML).

Originally called _Objective ML_, now this name is obsolete.
OCaml was designed and its first compiler implemented by
[Xavier Leroy](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/).

Its compiler is really fast, that's why even [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
was initially built using OCaml, until it can bootstrap itself.

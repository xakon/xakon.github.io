Even though HTML is not a difficult language to write, yet it is quite verbose.
That's why, a variety of different Markup languages have been invented, in order
to reduce the load of writing HTML.

Another approach is to use HTML template engines.  Now, we can write less
characters to produce the same HTML page.  Some of them are:

 - [Slim](https://slim-template.github.io/):  Ruby-based engine
 - [Plim](https://plim.readthedocs.io/):  The same engine written in Python

Interesting languages that I need to check and learn about:

 - Rust:	the system-language of the future
 - D:		amazing design and implementation
 - Nim:		really interesting system-language, with familiar syntax
 - Julia:	scripting language for statistics and not only
 - CommonLisp:	the most powerful programming language
 - Racket:	the most elegant Scheme-based Lisp, suitable for other languages
 - Go (obviously, this is my current assignment)
 - Tcl (should have learned it long ago)
 - Falcon (advertised as fast and optimized C++)

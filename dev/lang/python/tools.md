Python Tools
============

Interpreters
------------

 - [ipython][ipython]
 - [ptpython][ptpython]:  Amazing REPL interpreter!
 - [bpython][bpython]:
   A fancy curses interface to the Python interactive interpreter.

Debuggers
---------

 - [pudb](https://github.com/inducer/pudb):
   A reminder of Turbo Pascal IDE!

 - [Bugjar](http://pybee.org/bugjar/):
   Graphical interactive debugger for Python.


Linters
-------

 - [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/)
 - [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/)
 - [Pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)
 - [Pychecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/)


Profilers
---------

 - [Line Profiler](http://packages.python.org/line_profiler/):
   Display how fast and how often each line of code is running in scripts.

 - [Memory Profiler](https://github.com/fabianp/memory_profiler):
   Display memory usage of Python script.

 - [Objgraph](http://mg.pov.lt/objgraph/): This tool allows one to see the
   number of objects in memory and also locate all the different places in
   code that hold references to these objects.

 - [pytest-benchmark](https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark):
   `py.test` fixture for benchmarking code.


Test Runners
------------

 - [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/):
   My favourite test runner.  Small, fast, elegant.

 - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):
   Community's favourite test runner.
   I don't like it as it is super slow, super magical, super heavy on features.
   In short, it is not Pythonic in my opinion.

 - [hammett](https://github.com/boxed/hammett/):
   An alternative to `pytest`, which implements only a subset of `pytest`,
   but is super fast.


Misc
----

 - [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
   Managing Python packaging and dependencies in a modern way.
   The workflow of _Poetry_ reminds of _npm_.

 - [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/):
   An experimental package manager, that supports PEP-582, which means it can
   install and run packages locally, without needed a virtual environment.

 - [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/):
   "Python Dev Workflow for Humans":  the new and modern way of managing
   virtual environments, but also dependencies.  In a similar way as in
   [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) or
   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), `pipenv` brings a new era of managing Python
   dependencies and development environments.

 - [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv):
   Selectively install Python version for development, similar to
   [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

 - [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/):
   Test a Python package against multiple Python versions.

 - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)
 - [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/)
 - [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/)

 - [pip-review](https://pypi.org/project/pip-review/):
   Easily inspect and/or update all dependencies of a project.

 - [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv):
   Easily package all dependencies of a program in a `.zip` file.

 - [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/):
   Create a single executable out of the source code.

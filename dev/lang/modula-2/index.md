Modula-2
========

[Modula-2] is a derivative of [Pascal], the 3rd iteration of languages by
[Niklaus Wirth].

It's mainly a dead language, with no real applications today or in the past.
But, I'm reading a book by [Niklaus Wirth], _Algorithms and Data Structures_,
which in its 2nd edition uses the [Modula-2] for its programs, and I would like
to be able to run them and compare the results with another language.


Resources
---------

 - [Modula-2]:  official page.
   It contains plenty of resources, like compilers, references, even a tutorial
   of the language.

### Compilers ###

There are not many [Modula-2] compilers available anymore.

 - [GNU Modula-2]:
   Maybe the only available option out there.
   Like [GNU Pascal], the compiler is a series of patches to be applied on top
   of GCC, something that means we also need to build GCC.  In the future, it is
   quite likely that the patches will be included in the main GCC codebase, and
   then we will have some easily buildable code or even some binary patches.

   In the official site there are plenty of other resources, on how to build GCC
   with [GNU Modula-2] patches, to testing, even some resources on the language
   itself.

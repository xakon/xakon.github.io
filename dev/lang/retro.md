Retro Languages
===============

Some old, obsolete, or failed languages, which we can still build and learn.

[Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/) maintains a list of old, retro languages.
The list can be found at [The Retrocomputing Museum](http://www.catb.org/~esr/retro/).
Some of these languages are documented here.

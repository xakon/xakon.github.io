Retro Languages
===============

Some old, obsolete, or failed languages, which we can still build and learn.

[Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/) maintains a list of old, retro languages.
The list can be found at [The Retrocomputing Museum](http://www.catb.org/~esr/retro/).
Some of these languages are documented here.


INTERCAL
--------

A computer language designed by Don Woods and James Lyons in 1972.  _INTERCAL_ is
purposely different from all other computer languages in all ways but one; it is purely
a written language, being totally unspeakable.  Said by the authors to stand for
"Computer Language With No Pronounceable Acronym".
_INTERCAL_ devotees hang out on the <alt.lang.intercal> newsgroup.

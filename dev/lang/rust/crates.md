Crates
======

Even though Rust is a quite new language, there is already a vast and rich
amount of libraries, _crates_ in Rust's terms, from which a developer can choose
from.  Since this list is huge, I need to document a few of them, to have them
handy next time I need a _crate_ for a specific task.

As always, more information about these _crates_ and even more powerful search
tools can be found at the main [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) site.

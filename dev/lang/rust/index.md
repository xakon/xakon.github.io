Tools
-----

Rust, like Go, is rich of tools and probably it's built using the tool-set in
mind.

 - rustc:  compiler
 - cargo:  package manager, installed with the main distribution
 - [explaine.rs](https://jrvidal.github.io/explaine.rs/):
   Online documentation to explain elements of the language, as they appear in a
   script.
 - [Crates.io][crates]: central repository for Rust packages
 - [Crates.rs](https://crates.rs/):  an alternative to [Crates.io][crates]
 - [Docs.rs][docs]:  documentation coming from any *crate*
 - [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy):  Linter
 - [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt):  Code formatter.
 - [rustfix](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfix):
   Automatic resolve issues between Edition 2018 and older ones.
 - [racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer):  Auto-completion utility.
 - [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/):
   The new implementation of the
   [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
   for Rust.  It provides features like completion and goto definition for many code editors.
 - [Rust Language Server (RLS)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls):
   Language server (for symbol search, etc.)
   This tool is deprecated in favour of the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
   and probably not supported after Rust 1.64 release.
 - [kcov](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov):
   A general-purpose coverage tool.  It can be used against any DWARF-based
   executable, thus we can use it with Rust programs, too.
 - [async-std](https://async.rs/):
   A new runtime, based on the latest features of `async/await` of the language.
   The runtime, reimplements all blocking components of the _Standard Library_,
   and uses the auto-scaling ideas from Go's runtime.


Other
-----

 - [rtForth](https://github.com/chengchangwu/rtforth):  simple Forth implemented in Rust
   for real-time application.

 - [Aero](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/aero):
   An experimental, UNIX-like OS written in Rust.  It follows the monolithic
   kernel design and it is inspired by the [Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org/).
   It supports _modern_ PC features.

 - [NekoOS](https://github.com/NekoOS-Group/NekoOS):
   A Rust-based RISC-V OS.

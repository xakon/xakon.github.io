Long or Many Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A nice technique I recently discovered.  It reminds a lot the way we split in
Python long parameter lists in function calls.  The trick is to use the `where`
clause and very close to the function call, define the parameters as separate
bindings:

[source,haskell]
----
sendEmail myEmail
   where to   = "levi@startup.com"
         from = "chris@website.org"
	 body = "Hi!"
	 name = "Levi"
	 myEmail = Email from to body name
----

Actually, even the reverse order might read more like in Python:

[source,haskell]
----
sendEmail myEmail
   where myEmail = Email from to body name
         to      = "levi@startup.com"
         from    = "chris@website.org"
	 body    = "Hi!"
	 name    = "Levi"

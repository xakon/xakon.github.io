https://github.com/takenobu-hs/haskell-ghc-illustrated[GHC Illustrated]
provides some nice (although un-official) presentations about the internals
of GHC.

Commands can be abbreviated to single letter.

:q or :quit
:l or :load	load a new file
:r or :reload	reload last loaded file
:i or :info	associativity/precedence of operators and functions
:t or :type	find the type of an expression
:set		enable specific features of GHCi

Features of GHCi that can be enabled at run-time are:
 - `+t`		print the type of `it`
 - `-Wall`	enable more warnings and checks

At GHCi the latest evaluated expression is stored in the value of `it` and
can be freely used in the next expression.

Change its prompt (by default it's `Prelude>` with:

////
# Haskell
////

   :set prompt "GHCi> "
   :set prompt "Î»> "


////
# vim: set ft=asciidoc:
////

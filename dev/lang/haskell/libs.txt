Haskell Libraries
=================

I will try to document a few useful and well-known libraries used in Haskell.
Some of them might deserve special sections and further description.

 - `aeson`:  Fast JSON parsing and encoding.

 - `optparse-applicative`:  Utilities and combinators for parsing command-line
   options.

 - `async`:  Provide an API for executing and chaining asynchronous computations.

 - `stm` (Software Transactional Memory):
   Provide mutable data structures and operations on them that can be grouped
   together and performed as a single atomic operation.


Web Development
---------------

 - `mig`:  A library to write Web applications.
   Information can be found in the online book, https://anton-k.github.io/mig/[Mig by example].

Haskell Libraries
=================

I will try to document a few useful and well-known libraries used in Haskell.
Some of them might deserve special sections and further description.

 - `aeson`:  Fast JSON parsing and encoding.

 - `optparse-applicative`:  Utilities and combinators for parsing command-line
   options.

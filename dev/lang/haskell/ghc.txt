Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
==============================

GHC is the de-facto standard of Haskell compilers.

https://github.com/takenobu-hs/haskell-ghc-illustrated[GHC Illustrated]
provides some nice (although unofficial) presentations about the internals
of GHC.

Some modules that belong to the `base` package are available by default to
every Haskell program..  Others can be found out by running `ghc-pkg list`.
For example, we will be able to use other packages, installed using
`cabal` (`cabal install`) or Stack (`stack install`).

In the article https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide[Haskell Style Guide],
the author suggests that any Haskell module should be able to compile using the following
GHC warnings:

 - `-Wall`
 - `-Wincomplete-uni-patterns`
 - `-Wincomplete-record-updates`
 - `-Wcompat`
 - `-Widentities`
 - `-Wredundant-constraints`
 - `-Wmissing-export-lists`
 - `-Wpartial-fields`

Also, it is useful to enable `-fhide-source-paths` and `-freverse-errors`
for cleaner compiler output.

---------

 - [Hack the Kernel](https://www.ops-class.org/):
   Includes everything you need to learn about operating systems online.

 - [Redox](http://www.redox-os.org/):
   Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations
   of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.

 - [How to write a simple Operating System][mikeos-guide]:
   [MikeOS][mikeos] is a simple, x86-based OS, written in Assembly and with a
   goal to teach fundamentals of OSes to students.  There are also other forks
   of the OS that add other features (x86-64 support, ARM support, etc.).

 - [Operating Systems: from 0 to 1](https://github.com/tuhdo/os01):
   Nice tutorial on how to write an OS from scratch.

 - [Writing an OS in Rust](http://os.phil-opp.com)

 - [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/):
   A demonstration of how to build a Linux distribution by compiling everything,
   including the Kernel, the C library, and all the programs.
   I found a [Github repository][lfs-docker] with a helpful Docker image to
   play with _Linux From Scratch_.

Operating Systems
=================

Resources
---------

 - [Hack the Kernel](https://www.ops-class.org/):
   Includes everything you need to learn about operating systems online.

 - [Redox](http://www.redox-os.org/):
   Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations
   of Rust to a modern micro-kernel and full set of applications.

   Actually, I read a very nice article, introduction to Redox, and got
   immediately sold with it!  The article can be found at:
   [Programming for Redox OS](https://dev.to/legolord208/programming-for-redox-os-4124).

 - [How to write a simple Operating System][mikeos-guide]:
   [MikeOS][mikeos] is a simple, x86-based OS, written in Assembly and with a
   goal to teach fundamentals of OSes to students.  There are also other forks
   of the OS that add other features (x86-64 support, ARM support, etc.).

 - [Operating Systems: from 0 to 1](https://github.com/tuhdo/os01):
   Nice tutorial on how to write an OS from scratch.

 - [Writing an OS in Rust](http://os.phil-opp.com)

 - [Linux From Scratch][LFS]:
   A demonstration of how to build a Linux distribution by compiling everything,
   including the Kernel, the C library, and all the programs.
   I found a [Github repository][lfs-docker] with a helpful Docker image to
   play with _Linux From Scratch_.  This book scratches only the start of
   creating a custom Linux distribution.  It is continued in other book series,
   like for example in [Beyond Linux From Scratch][BLFS].  At this point, it might
   be useful to use the [AryaLinux](http://aryalinux.org/), as it is not only a
   Linux distribution, but it also provides build scripts, based on
   [Linux From Scratch][LFS], to build from the scratch a distribution.

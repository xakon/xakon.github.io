LeaseWeb
========

Stuff I collected while working at LeaseWeb.

 - [Maurits van der Schee](https://github.com/mevdschee):
   Plenty of nice stuff at Maurit's Github account.

 - [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/):
   Mongoose is the most easy to use web server on the planet. A web server of
   choice for Web developers (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc) and Web designers.

   Mongoose is built on top of libmongoose embedded library, which can turn
   anything into a web server in 5 minutes worth of effort and few lines of
   code.  Libmongoose is used to serve Web GUI on embedded devices, implement
   RESTful services, RPC frameworks (e.g. JSON-RPC), handle telemetry data
   exchange, and perform many other tasks in various different industries
   including aerospace, manufacturing, finance, research, automotive, gaming,
   IT.

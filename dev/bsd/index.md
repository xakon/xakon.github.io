### Journals

 - [FreeBSD Journal](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/journal/):
   A paid edition, but not very expensive.  Consider it as a must if you start
   working with a [FreeBSD][freebsd] system.

 - [OpenBSD Journal](http://undeadly.org/)

 - [BSD Magazine](https://bsdmag.org/)


### Tutorials

 - [Getting Started with FreeBSD][digitalocean] by Digital Ocean.
   Digital Ocean offers FreeBSD VPS solutions, so it has a comprehensive set of
   tutorials on FreeBSD, as it does for any other aspect they support.

   [FreeBSD][freebsd] with the amazing i3 Desktop Manager.

### Sources

At <http://minnie.tuhs.org/>, I found archives of the early versions of BSD.
For example, I can get the sources of the
[1BSD](http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/UCB/1bsd.tar.gz),
by Bill Joy himself!  There is a ton of interesting material there to study,
including manual/help pages, Pascal interpreter, and other utilities.

 - [RetroBSD](https://github.com/RetroBSD/retrobsd):
   A lightweight UNIX-like OS, inspired and based by BSD 2.11, for 8-bit and
   16-bit MCUs.  Even though the development seems to have stopped, it still
   can serve as an education material and inspiration to some C programmers.

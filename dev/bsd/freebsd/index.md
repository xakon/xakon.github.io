## Testing

FreeBSD started a test project, the [FreeBSD Testing Project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/TestSuite).
There are some [tutorials on how to write tests](https://wiki.freebsd.org/TestSuite/DeveloperHowTo),
and some sample tests.

It is the perfect opportunity for somebody to jump into the project and become an advanced
BSD developer!

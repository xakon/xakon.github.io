RISC OS
=======

The operating system that ARM (actually, it was Acorn, later split into many
departments, one of them was ARM)) built to ship with the Acorn Archimedes is
now open-sourced and runs on many platforms.

The main problem of this OS is the lack of SMP support, something very common in
ARM architectures, where many cores, sometimes with different performance
setups, are deployed.

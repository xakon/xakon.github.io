REST
====

These days RESTful services are very common on Web and mobile applications.
Even me has been asked once to implement some of their kind!

I found an interesting article, where the author shows how one can easily and
quickly implement some simple REST services using only
[Nginx](http://nginx.org/) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/):
[Simple API with Nginx and PostreSQL](http://rny.io/nginx/postgresql/2013/07/26/simple-api-with-nginx-and-postgresql.html).

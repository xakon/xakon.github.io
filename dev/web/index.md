### Web Servers ###

 - [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)
 - [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
 - [thttpd](http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/):
   A simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
   Suitable to be used in constraint environments, like embedded systems,
   or loaded systems with other applications.

### Tools

 * [BSD, C, http, SQLite (BCHS)](https://learnbchs.org/):
   An alternative stack for Web applications, based mainly on OpenBSD and
   simple tools.

 * [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com/):
   It measures the speed of a Web page and recommends some solutions.

 * [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/)
   Software testing framework for web applications.

 * [No Design Development](https://nodesign.dev/):
   A collection of resources and auto-generated art/design for Web sites, for
   developers that have little to no artistic talent.

 * Abduction (Firefox Extension)
   Screenshots of Web pages

 * [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/): "Web Accelerator" which a
   sysadmin can use to speed a website.  It can cache certain static
   elements, such as images or javascript, but one can also use it for
   other purposes such as Load Balancing or some additional security.

 * [G-WAN Web Server](http://gwan.com/):
   The fastest web server ever!

 * [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks):
   A JavaScript library that makes navigating a Web application faster.
   It gives to the user the impression that a server-rendered application is a
   Single-Page Application.  It works with many frameworks, but also with
   static sites.

 * [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python):
   An alternative to [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to test web
   application in the browser.  Implemented by Microsoft, it promises faster
   and easier integration with the most popular browsers.  It integrates with
   [pytest](http://pytest.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
   There are also versions for [JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
   and potentially for other languages.


### Frameworks

 * [webalchemy](https://github.com/skariel/webalchemy):
   Realtime, Pythonic web framework.

 * [verlure](https://github.com/bbangert/velruse):
   Simplifying third-party authentication for web applications.

 * [Piwik](http://piwik.org/): An alternative to Google's Analytics,
   running locally on the deployed web server.  There is also a handfull
   [demo](http://demo.piwik.org/).

 * [django-tastypie](http://tastypieapi.org/):
   Webservice API framework for Django. It provides a convenient, yet
   powerful and highly customizable abstraction for creating REST-style
   interfaces.

 * [flask-restful](https://github.com/twilio/flask-restful):
   Simple framework for creating REST APIs.

 * [flask-foundation](https://github.com/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation):
   A solid foundation for web application.

 * [flask-slither](http://github.com/gevious/flask_slither):
   A small library between MongoDB and JSON API endpoints.

 * [React]:
   The dominant JavaScript framework to write _Single-Page Applications_ (SPA).
   It relies on custom template language, _JSX_, and partial rendering of the
   page's DOM, upon AJAX requests.

 * [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/):
   A fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework.  Build small
   websites and REST APIs in seconds.  All the framework is just one `.py` file
   that you can drop in your directory.

[React]:	https://reactjs.org/

### Libraries ###

 - [htmx](https://htmx.org/):
   An alternative library to [React] or similar JavaScript frameworks, to write
   simple _Single-Page Applications_ (SPA).  It is a small HTML library, that
   extends HTML and let's us update dynamically an HTML page by issuing backend
   requests, but render HTML responses, not JSON.  The difference to the backend
   on rendering HTML vs. JSON is not that much, and it lets us use our common
   tools, like _Django Templates_, to render SPA sites.

### Other ###

 - [Mono Icons](https://icons.mono.company/)
 - [SVG Spinners](https://github.com/n3r4zzurr0/svg-spinners):
   A collection of small, animated SVN icons, that can be used in a Web
   application.

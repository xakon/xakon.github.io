Browsers
========

To access the Web we need a Web browser.  There are plenty of them to choose
from, either graphical or text-based ones.

Graphical
---------

 - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

 - [Diloo](https://www.dillo.org/):
   A lightweight browser that is built using the [Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK)[FLTK].
   It lacks many features but it works pretty well on basic web pages.

 - [NetSurf](https://www.netsurf-browser.org/):
   Small as mouse, fast as cheetah and available for free.
   A multi-platform Web browser for [RISC OS](http://www.riscosopen.org/),
   UNIX-like platforms (including Linux), macOS, and more.

 - [Otter Browser](https://otter-browser.org/):
   A Qt-based browser, which runs on multiple platforms, even on RISC OS.

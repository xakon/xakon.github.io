Tools
-----

It's always useful to have in our disposal UNIX tools, even on Windows.
We have plenty of options here:

 - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/):
   The default option, that turns a Windows machine almost into a UNIX box.

 - [Gow](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow):
   A lightweight alternative to Cygwin.  It ships only with a few UNIX tools
   (around 100 of them), compiled into native Win32 applications.

 - [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/)

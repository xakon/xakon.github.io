Debuggers

Some notes and resources for understanding and building a debugger.

Note, that for a list of various debuggers and tools, there is a separate page,
which can be found at `"Tools: debuggers" <tools/debuggers.md>`_.

Online
------

The article `Learning about debuggers <https://werat.dev/blog/learning-about-debuggers/>`_
contains so many resources, that it is impossible to copy all of them here.  Instead,
try to follow them at the original site.  It really pays off just to skim at those
resources (courses, books, papers, tutorials, articles).

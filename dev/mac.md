Mac OS X
========

Some useful tools of Mac OS X that have similar Linux counterparts,
but different names:

 - `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`
 - `open`
 - `mdfind`
 - `screencapture`
 - `launchctl`
 - `say`
 - `diskutil`
 - `brew`
 - [DevUtils.app](https://devutils.app/):
   A GUI collection of simple conversions, useful for developers.
   Most of these can be done using command-line tools, though.

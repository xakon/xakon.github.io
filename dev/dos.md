DOS
===

Yes, it's true that MS-DOS is dead since long ago.
Yet, there is sometimes a need to run old programs or games on that platform.
Here I present some solutions.


### DOSBox

[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) is a Linux program, that emulates MS-DOS.
It reads files directly from a Linux directory, so the transfer of information
between the 2 worlds is seamless.  The only problem is the performance, not that
it should matter too much anymore.


### FreeDOS

[FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/) is a complete rewrite of the MS-DOS.
As that, it should be installed on a hard-disk and run on a virtual machine
(or on a physical machine).  Actually, it comes with more features than the
latest MS-DOS, but its compatibility is astonishing.  The best way to run old
DOS programs.

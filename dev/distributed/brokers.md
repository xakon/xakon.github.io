Message Brokers
===============

[Message Brokers][wikipedia] is such a fundamental component of an Enterprise Distributed System.
They provide means for different other components to communicate asynchronously while working on different speeds.

For some reason, I didn't follow at the time the changes and advances in Enterprise Software.
[Message Brokers][wikipedia] is one of them.  I need to come back.

Libraries
---------

 - [nanomsg][nanomsg]:  Really light-weight!
 - [âˆ…MQ][zmq]:  ZeroMQ, the best way to use Networking!
 - [Raft][raft]:  More comments follow.
 - [MQTT][mqtt]:  Lightweight protocol, great for IoT devices
 - [AMQT][amqt]:  The "standard" Enterprise solution.


### Raft

In an excellent article at [Gopher Academy][gopher] I've read the [Raft][raft]
protocol for building Distributed Systems.  Maybe I can apply these techniques
in a project like the CDN Bots (just for fun, of course).

Some references from this article are:

 - [Writing a Distributed Systems Library in Go][article]
 - [Go-Raft][go-raft]


### MQTT

It seems that [MQTT][mqtt] is the new kid on the block regarding message brokers.
It is a light-weight protocol of Publish/Subscribe implementations, with a lot of
configurability and flexibility, with many language implementations, and suitable
for IoT implementations.

There is a very interesting introduction of the protocol in a
[LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/753705/), which I keep here for future
reference.  Also, I read a very nice tutorial in [Page Fault][pagefault-tutorial]
on how exactly we can use [MQTT][mqtt] with micro-controllers.
The design of such an implementation for IoT devices is also presented in a
[Page Fault article][pagefault-design].

[pagefault-design]:   https://pagefault.blog/2017/03/02/using-local-mqtt-broker-for-cloud-and-interprocess-communication/

There are many implementations of the protocol, one of them is
[Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/).

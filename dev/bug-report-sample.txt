Symptom:
Infinite loop when decoding Q.931 message

Cause:
When an unknown element id is found in a Q.931 message, we try
to skip it by reading the length, and advancing the pos pointer
that many bytes. However, in this case the length was zero,
causing us to try to skip the same element id over and over.

How found:
This happened during parsing of a setup message taken from an
Ethereal trace from Nortel. Their message was 1016 bytes long
(it included a lot of fast start elements), but our MSG_MAX_LEN
was 1000. Normally we then receive a truncated message from
common/Communication.cxx, but now, when fed directly in to be
parsed, memory past the end of the array was accessed, and it
happened to be zero, exposing this problem.
To find it, I just added a few print outs in the q931 parsing
code. But it was lucky that the data happened to be zero.

Fix:
If the length given is zero, set it to one. This way we always
move forward.

Fixed in file(s):
callh/q931_msg.cxx

Caused by me:
Yes

Time taken to resolve bug:
1 hour

Lessons:
Trusted the data received in an incoming message. It's not
just giving huge numbers that can cause problems. Indicating
a length of zero could be just as bad.

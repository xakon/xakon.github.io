DBM
===

[DBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBM_(computing)) is a set of key-value
databases, usually memory-persistent.

The original `dbm` implementation was by Ken Thomson for UNIX.

Some common, modern implementations include:

 - `ndbm` (new `dbm`).
 - [GNU DBM](https://www.gnu.org.ua/software/gdbm/):
   GNU implementation of `dbm`.
 - [Berkeley DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/)
 - [LMDB](https://symas.com/lmdb/):
   Lightning Memory-mapped Database.  Super fast!

These libraries are mainly written in C.
There are plenty of bindings for other languages, like Python, Perl, Tcl, etc.

Fonts
=====

Install Fonts on Linux
----------------------

```
   $ cp FILES ~/.fonts
   $ fc-cache -f -v
```

Fonts can be further organized into subdirectories, to keep them well organized.

A nice Web application, called [Programming Fonts](https://app.programmingfonts.org/),
allows one to view and try more than 50 free fonts on the browser.  A nice
add-on, on choosing what better fits to someone.

 - [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/)
 - [Stix Fonts](http://www.stixfonts.org/):
   An OpenType collection of fonts.
   Currently at v2.0, an amazing collection of Unicode Math fonts, but which
   they also contain nice glyphs for other Unicode planes.  Even the Greek
   glyphs are amazing.
   Since they are OpenType fonts, there are some problems setting up old TeX
   engines to work with them.  I think, the project released Type-1 versions of
   the fonts, as well.
 - [JetBranis Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/):
   A font for developers from a Software House!
 - [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/):
   A monospace font with many weights, languages, and ligatures.
   It was made to support programming in Julia and scientific programming in
   general.
 - [Atkinson Hyperlegible Font](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont):
   A typeface that offers greater legibility and readability for low vision
   readers.  From the [Braille Institute](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/).
   That says a lot!
 - [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)
 - [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/):
   An elegant, crispy, monospace font, with many ligatures and optional
   semi-connected cursive italics.

Variable Fonts

allow the same font file to be used in any way the user desires.  It's still a
new project, but it will gain a high moment in awhile.

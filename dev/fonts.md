Fonts

Install Fonts on Linux
----------------------

```
   $ cp FILES ~/.fonts
   $ fc-cache -f -v
```

Fonts can be further organized into subdirectories, to keep them well organized.

A nice Web application, called [Programming Fonts](https://app.programmingfonts.org/),
allows one to view and try more than 50 free fonts on the browser.  A nice
add-on, on choosing what better fits to someone.

 - [Stix Fonts](http://www.stixfonts.org/):
   An OpenType collection of fonts.
   Currently at v2.0, an amazing collection of Unicode Math fonts, but which
   they also contain nice glyphs for other Unicode planes.  Even the Greek
   glyphs are amazing.
   Since they are OpenType fonts, there are some problems setting up old TeX
   engines to work with them.  I think, the project released Type-1 versions of
   the fonts, as well.

More fonts can be found and tested at <http://programmingfonts.org>

some of them offering nothing else apart from the Math symbols.

Variable Fonts
--------------

At <https://v-fonts.com/>, there is a whole new technology from Microsoft, to
allow the same font file to be used in any way the user desires.  It's still a
new project, but it will gain a high moment in awhile.

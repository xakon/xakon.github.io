Server
======

Operations that a server need to handle:

- Source-Code Repositories (Git/Subversion/Mercurial)
- Backups
- Continuous Integration Server (Jenkins)


Tools
-----

- [logcheck](http://logcheck.org/):
  Scan logs, summarize them and email results.

- [portspoof](http://portspoof.org/):
  Enhance server's security by emulating legitimate service signatures on
  otherwise closed ports, making thus scanning software slower and its output
  more difficult to interpret.


Hardware
--------

 - [Utilite Mini PC](http://utilite-computer.com/web/home):
   This machine is ARM-based, comes in many setups (single-core, dual-core,
   quad-core, 2-4GB, HDMI, SD cards) and costs around $100.  It also comes
   bundled with Linux Mint and is manufactured by the creator of MintBox.

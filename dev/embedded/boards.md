A collection of affordable development boards.
A better list, coming from an expert, that includes development kits
suitable for low-level experiments, can be found at
[Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/dev-kits/).

 - [Freescale Freedom FRDM-KL25Z][frdm-kl25z]:
   Quite cheap, around $13.  ARMv7 processor (48MHz, 16K RAM, 128K Flash memory),
   together with USB, SPI, UART, I2C, PWM peripherals.
 - [ODROID](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/):
   C2 and C3 boards have 64-bit ARM CPUs.
 - [Packet](https://www.packet.net/):
   Online hardware for bare-metal `aarch64` systems.  It's like AWS for ARM hardware!

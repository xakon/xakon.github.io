Boards
======

A collection of affordable development boards.
A better list, coming from an expert, that includes development kits
suitable for low-level experiments, can be found at
[Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/dev-kits/).

 - [Freescale Freedom FRDM-KL25Z][frdm-kl25z]:
   Quite cheap, around $13.  ARMv7 processor (48MHz, 16K RAM, 128K Flash memory),
   together with USB, SPI, UART, I2C, PWM peripherals.
 - [ODROID](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/):
   C2 and C3 boards have 64-bit ARM CPUs.
 - [Packet](https://www.packet.net/):
   Online hardware for bare-metal `aarch64` systems.  It's like AWS for ARM hardware!
 - [96Boards](https://www.96boards.org/)
 - PINE64:  Found a review for this powerful board at
   <https://www.linux.com/news/build-20-computer-pine64>.
 - Nucleo STM32F446RE:
   In general, any STM32-based board will suffice.

Some other tiny and cheap boards can be (TODO: more info to be added):

 - ESP32
 - Teensy 40


Arduino
-------

[Arduino][arduino] provides a wide-range of beginner-friendly boards, but also
many professional toolkits.

 - Arduino Portenta H7:
   It features a dual 32-bit ARM core, with ARM Corent-M7 (480MHz) and Cortex-M4
   (240MHz).  Loaded with many interesting peripherals.  Suitable for IoT
   developments, but a bit expensive.

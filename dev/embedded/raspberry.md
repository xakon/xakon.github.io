Raspberry Pi
============

Projects
--------

 - [Build GCC as cross-compiler for Raspberry Pi][rasp-gcc]
   Working on a Raspberry Pi will need a decent compiler.
   Even though that Raspbian comes with GCC 6, we can build a cross-compiler on
   Linux for ARM Linux and have GCC 8 and build programs on a fast, Linux host,
   instead of the slow Raspberry Pi!

 - [Raspberry Cluster][cluster]:
   There are many videos introducing a cluster or mini-computer using many Pis in
   parallel.  On this blog I can also find step-by-step instructions on how one
   can build his own cluster using mainly Raspberry Pis.

 - [Plan9 on Pi][plan9]:
   Demo of how to run Plan9 on a Raspberry Pi.

 - [Raspberry Pi on QEMU](https://azeria-labs.com/emulate-raspberry-pi-with-qemu/)
 - [Some Qemu images to play with](https://blahcat.github.io/2017/06/25/qemu-images-to-play-with/)

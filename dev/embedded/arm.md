### Distributions ###

We need an RTOS or another OS, suitable for embedded devices, to run something
on an ARM-based single-computer (SBC).  For embedded Linux, here are useful
resources:

 - [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/):
   Specialised Linux distributions (based on Debian or Ubuntu) that can run on
   an ARM-based SBC.  It supports many boards out-of-the box, but there are
   instructions on how to build and install it on an unsupported board.

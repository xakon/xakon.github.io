Terminal
========

The dominant library for programming in terminal-based applications is the [ncurses][ncurses].
There are many bindings of this library for almost every programming language.
It is even shipped with the Standard Library in Python.

Another lightweight and well promised library is the [termbox][termbox].
It also has a lot of bindings.

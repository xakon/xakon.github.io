Stuff I collected while working at [NL-ix](https://www.nl-ix.net).


People
------

 - [Robin Schulz](https://gist.github.com/bulletinmybeard):
   Plenty of nice stuff at Robin's Github account.
   He mainly publishes short gists on various topics.
   He also has a [Medium blog](https://rschu.me), but not very active lately.
   Again, good, short articles on how-to fix problems guides.

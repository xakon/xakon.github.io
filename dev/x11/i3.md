i3 Window Manager
=================

General
-------

[i3wm][i3wm] comes with 3 tools together:  `dmenu`, `i3status`, and `i3lock`.
We can replace `i3status` with `i3blocks` and `dmenu` with [rofi][rofi].
People use various fonts to configure their **workspaces** and their
status line.  I don't like so much the idea of having fonts in the workspaces,
although I should try it, but they are very helpful for the status line.
One great font with icons for this purpose is [Font Awesome][font-awesome].
A [CheatSheet][font-cheatsheet] is necessary to look up the codes for each
icon.  And a preview of the icons, of course!


### Wallpapers

A program to use for wallpapers can be [feh][2].


### Monitors

Managing monitors either with `xrandr` or with its graphical counter-part,
the so-used in LeaseWeb, [arandr][4]


### Launcher

`dmenu` is very basic and doesn't accept a lot of configuration options.
[rofi][rofi], on the other hand, is more powerful.

[i3][i3wm] doesn't allow transparent windows.  In order for [rofi][rofi] to
appear *over* the desktop, we can use another program, as is the
[compton][compton], a compositor for X11.


### Desktop Notifications

We can use `dunst` for them.


### Network Manager

I should try and use `NetworkManager` with [i3][i3wm] as I do in Gnome.


### Clipboard Manager

I have the feeling, I can always use `Clipit` with [i3][i3wm].
Only if I could find out how to configure it!


### Sound

No idea yet.  Maybe `pavucontrol`.


### Editor

The editor is the main component of the [i3][i3wm] window manager.
Everything is made so that we can launch many editors, fast and simply.
Since we can have many windows open at the same time, there is no point
to use `terminator` anymore.  Am I going to miss terminal tabs from
`gnome-terminal`?  Not really, as this is also supported by the window
manager.

So, I need something simple, customizable, and light.  Most of the people
I know are using `urxvt`.


Misc
----

Most of the customizations I know come from the excellent screencast
found at [CodeCast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARKIwOlazKI).
Keep them as a reference!  ([Dotfiles](https://github.com/alexbooker/dotfiles/))

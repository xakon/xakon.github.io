Openbox
=======

Another alternative, light-weight desktop manager is the [Openbox][openbox].

I found [this article](https://fedoramagazine.org/openbox-fedora/) in
[Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/) quite interesting and decided
to keep a reference to it.

Some tools to accompany the [Openbox][openbox]:

 - [feh][feh]:
   Utility to set a wallpaper for the desktop

 - [xbacklight][xbacklight]:
   Utility to set laptop screen brightness

 - [conky][conky]:
   Utility to display system information

 - [tint2][tint2]:
   System panel/taskbar

 - `xorg-x11-drv-libinput`:
   Driver that lets the system activate clicks on tap in a laptop touchpad

 - [volumeicon][volumeicon]:
   Volume control for the system tray

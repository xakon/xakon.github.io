X Server

Some notes about this beast that I ignore.  There are many options, programs,
settings and libraries to study about.


## Fonts

There are X core fonts and FreeType fonts (supplied by Pango).
To generate an X core font description, xfontsel(1).

A FreeType font description is composed by a font family, a style, a weight,
a variant, a stretch and a size.

## Keyboard

Key layouts are supplied by xmodmap(1).

To get the current mapping of the keyboard, use `xmodmap -pke`.
To interactively enter a key and see what keysym it is configured to,
use `xev`.

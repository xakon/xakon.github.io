Benchmarks
==========

I can always run a command using Bash's `time` built-in or the `time(1)`
command-line utility.  But, of course, there are many alternatives, better on
specific tasks.

 - [bench](https://github.com/Gabriel439/bench):
   A benchmark tool written in Haskell that can benchmark any Shell pipeline
   (and not just single commands).  It's built around the `criterion` library,
   giving very useful and interesting output, and it supports many options.

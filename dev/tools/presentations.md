Presentations
=============

Even though we consider that a presentation should be a graphical application,
there can be alternatives, either for HTML pages or even in terminal!

Some tools I can use for graphical or command-line presentations.

 - [tpp (Text Powerpoint)](https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp)
 - [present](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present)
 - [patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat):
   Terminal-based presentations using Pandoc.
 - [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp):
   Command-line, markdown-based presentation tool.
 - [tpp](https://synflood.at/tpp.html):
   A Ruby-based, command-line, markdown-based, presentation tool.
 - [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/):
   X11 presentation tool, that works like _mdp_.

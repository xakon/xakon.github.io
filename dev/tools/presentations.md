Presentations
=============

Even though we consider that a presentation should be a graphical application,
there can be alternatives, either for HTML pages or even in terminal!

Some tools I can use for graphical or command-line presentations.

 - [tpp (Text Powerpoint)](https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp)
 - [present](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present)
 - [patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat):
   Terminal-based presentations using Pandoc.
 - [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp):
   Command-line, markdown-based presentation tool.
 - [tpp](https://synflood.at/tpp.html):
   A Ruby-based, command-line, markdown-based, presentation tool.
 - [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/):
   X11 presentation tool, that works like _mdp_.
 - [Racket Slideshow](https://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/):
   An alternative approach for Browser-based presentations, using a Racket
   package.

For fancy presentations, we have the following applications:

 - [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides):
   Write presentations in Markdown, run them in the terminal.
   It supports code-highlighting, diagrams.
   This is a Go application.

 - [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev):
   The most powerful and fancy application to run Markdown-based presentations
   in the browser, supporting graphics and other visual elements.
   It supports code-highlighting, diagrams, LaTeX equations.
   It can record the presentation or export it in a PDF.
   It is written in Node.js.

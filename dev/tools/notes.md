Note Applications
=================

Yes, I know that the title is a bit of irony!
I prefer writing notes at the terminal, using my favourite editor,
organize them in directories, and use my favourite search tools.
Unfortunately, what I lack with this scheme are:

 - non-encrypted content
 - failure to view and edit the notes on mobile devices

I tried for quite a bit [Evernote][evernote];  in the beginning it was cool,
but after awhile its mobile clients started to suck and lately they changed
their licence and I can't use it anymore.

Some alternatives:

 - [Joplin][joplin]:
   Maybe the best alternative to Evernote.  With clients for major desktops,
   Android and iOS clients, even for the command-line!  It supports multiple
   back-ends for synchronization, currently only Microsoft's OneDrive.
   Support for Dropbox is about to be merged in the project.

   The only problem:
   it is written in JavaScript, which means, difficulties for me to build and
   use it.

   I read about Joplin in an [Opensource article][joplin-article].  I can find
   more information and introduction about the program there.

 - [Paperwork][paperwork]:
   Open-Source, but I have to manually host it.

 - [Laverna][laverna]:
   Open-Source, there is a self-hosted service.

 - [Permanote][permanote]:
   Open-Source, very simple application.

 - [Brainstorm][brainstorm]:
   A bit different in spirit and design.

 - [iCloud][icloud]:
   Closed-Source, and only available for OS X and iOS.

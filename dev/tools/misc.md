Tools
=====

Of course, we use every day compilers, interpreters, editors, debuggers,
profilers and other tools to perform our job.  But, there is also another
category of tools that relate to development indirectly.  Here are some notes
about such stuff.

[Web Developer Tools](https://www.browserling.com/tools).

[patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat):
Terminal-based presentations using Pandoc.

[Linux Performance Tools](http://brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html).

Pomodoro Timers
---------------

I found the [Pomohoro][https://github.com/kqr/Pomohoro] tool (built in Haskell)
to implement a Pomodoro timer, but also keep statistics in
[hledger timeclock](http://hledger.org/timeclock.html) format.
More on this at [hledger.org](http://hledger.org/) home, which I also need to check.


SSH

More info at this [page][tools/ssh.html].


Time Tracking
-------------

 - [Harvest](http://harvestapp.com/): A tool to track down time spent and
   earning money.

 - [Timelog Tracker](http://mg.pov.lt/gtimelog/):
   A small GTK+ time tracking application.
   Its main goal is to be as unintrusive as possible.

Mail Utilities
--------------

- sSMTP: Of course, I can use all the local utilities to write and send emails
  (like mutt, elm, mail, mailx, Mail, etc.), but all these need from me to
  setup an email server at my host.  Another solution is to use the sSMTP, which
  acts like mail(1) but sends the emails through an SMTP service (like GMail or
  Yahoo!Mail).

DNS Server
----------

 - dnsmasq: A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.

 - [NDS](http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/):
   Name Server Daemon is an authoritative only, high performance, simple and
   open source name server.  it does not do DNS forwarding, it only serves its
   own domains. but this could be enough for your project.

 - [dhcp.io](http://http//dhcp.io/):
   Alternative to DynDNS, now that the latter is not free anymore.

Calendar Server
---------------

 - [Radicale](http://radicale.org/):
   A simple Calendar (CalDAV) and Contact (CardDAV) server.

OpenSSL
-------

More information at a separate [page][tools/openssl.html].

Easily configure a Web server using this [tool](https://cipherli.st/).


File Managers
-------------

 - [Gentoo File Manager](http://obsession.se/gentoo/)
 - [Xfe](http://roland65.free.fr/xfe/)
 - [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/)

Misc
----

 - [Boinc](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/):
   Open-source software for volunteer computing.  Also the
   [Debian Wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/BOINC) might be interesting.

sudo(8)
=======

This tool is powerful and provides many opportunities to the users and the
administrators of a system.  Unfortunately, with great power comes also
great complexity.  Yes, `sudo(8)` is very complex and I cannot actually
understand its internals and/or the configuration files.

A nice [article in Opensource.com][sudo-article] helped me to distinguish
some aspects of the program.  I will keep it here as a reference for future
configurations.

Debuggers
=========

Terminology
-----------

I'm always confused with the terms used in various debuggers.  It's time to resolve them for goood!

breakpoint:
    Stop execution at specified line (function, ...)
conditional breakpoint:
    Stop execution at specified line (function, ...) when a condition is met
hit breakpoint:
    Stop execution at specified line (function, ...) after a number of passes
watchpoint:
    Stop execution after a variable has changed value
catchpoint:
    Stop execution after an exception is raised

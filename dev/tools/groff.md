Troff/Groff
===========

Actually, this is a huge family of tools, with many variations and
complimentary utilities.  I will try to document as many as possible.


Groff
-----

Officially called _GNU troff_, people know it as _groff_.
The GNU re-implementation of the [troff](https://www.troff.org/) family of tools.

 - [Home Page](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/)
 - [Troff Manual](https://www.troff.org/54.pdf),
   by Joseph Ossanna and Brian Kernighan  
   Publication from 1992, extensively revised by Brian Kernighan.


Manual Pages
------------

One of the main uses of _troff(1)_ is to format online manual pages for
programs, libraries, system calls, files, etc.  There are many packages for this
purpose:

 - [Groff man](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man.7.html)
 - [Groff_mdoc](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_mdoc.7.html)
 - [BSD mdoc](http://mandoc.bsd.lv/)

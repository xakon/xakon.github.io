Actually, this is a huge family of tools, with many variations and
complimentary utilities.  I will try to document as many as possible.

Manual Pages
------------

One of the main uses of _troff(1)_ is to format online manual pages for
programs, libraries, system calls, files, etc.  There are many packages for this
purpose:

 - [Groff man](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man.7.html)
 - [Groff_mdoc](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_mdoc.7.html)

Email Servers
=============

I've read a nice tutorial article at Xmodulo, on how `email servers work`_.
I copy some of ther terms mentioned in this article, since I'm going to find
them again in the future, while I will try to setup my own mail server.

The next article in the series is `How to secure a mail server using encryption`_.
I should use it as a quick reference to add SSL/TLS encryption into my own
mail server.

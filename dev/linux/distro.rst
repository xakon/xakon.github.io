Main Distributions
==================

Void Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

I read very nice things about `Void Linux`_:  it is minimal, has its own package manager,
it resembles FreeBSD, it is rolling release and highly optimized like Arch, it has
`runit` as a lightweight init manager.  It is worth to have a look at it.

Tiny Distributions
==================

Alpine Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Alpine Linux`_ is a very small Linux distribution, very popular in use with
containers.

Puppy Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~

`Puppy Linux`_ is a LiveCD, minimal Linux distribution, which brings many
innovations in the field.  I always want to play with it and customize one
similar distribution!

MX Linux
~~~~~~~~

`MX Linux`_ is a LiveCD, minimal Linux distribution, based on Debian.
It works amazingly well if installed on a USB, external disk, as it supports
persistent storage.  It comes preconfigured only with XFCE.

Quirky Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Quirky Linux`_ is created from the creator of the `Puppy Linux`_, but has
nothing else to do with `Puppy Linux`_:  it is based on Ubuntu, but carries
many innovations.  A great pocket distribution to have available.

SliTaz Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`SliTaz Linux`_ is not a very large distribution, but it is very powerful and
lightweight.

`Porteus`_ offers a few desktop options, but it's still very lightweight.

installation.

A very small, tiny Linux, only a few MBs of installation disk.
`Damn Small Linux`_ is suitable to run on old machines or even run from RAM.

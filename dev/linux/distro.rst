Void Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

I read very nice things about `Void Linux`:  it is minimal, has its own package manager,
it resembles FreeBSD, it is rolling release and highly optimized like Arch, it has
`runit` as a lightweight init manager.  It is worth to have a look at it.

Damn Small Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very small, tiny Linux, only a few MBs of installation disk.
`Damn Small Linux`_ is suitable to run on old machines or even run from RAM.

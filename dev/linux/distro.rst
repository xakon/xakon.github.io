Linux Distributions
===================

There are plenty and different distributions for Linux.
Here, I will try to categorize and document a few of them.




TODO:  Add table with each Distro characteristics

Debian	dpkg/apt	.deb	systemd
Ubuntu	dpkg/apt        .deb    systemd
Gentoo
Arch
LXDE
Void


Void Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

I read very nice things about `Void Linux`_:  it is minimal, has its own package manager,
it resembles FreeBSD, it is rolling release and highly optimized like Arch, it has
`runit` as a lightweight init manager.  It is worth to have a look at it.

Alpine Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Alpine Linux`_ is a very small Linux distribution, very popular in use with
containers.

Puppy Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~

`Puppy Linux`_ is a LiveCD, minimal Linux distribution, which brings many
innovations in the field.  I always want to play with it and customize one
similar distribution!

Quirky Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Quirky Linux`_ is created from the creator of the `Puppy Linux`_, but has
nothing else to do with `Puppy Linux`_:  it is based on Ubuntu, but carries
many innovations.  A great pocket distribution to have available.

Damn Small Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very small, tiny Linux, only a few MBs of installation disk.
`Damn Small Linux`_ is suitable to run on old machines or even run from RAM.

Nanolinux
~~~~~~~~~

`Nanolinux`_ is a tiny Linux distribution.  Quite impressive for its minimal size.

=======================
Other Operating-Systems
=======================

Of course, there's not only Linux out there.  There are many other operating
systems for someone to consider as alternatives, especially if he/she cares
about studying them.

Minix
*****

Minix, of course, is the source of Linux, or the source of everything!
`Minix3 <http://www.minix3.org/>`_ is the 3rd version of the OS, but
it has diverged a lot from the original goal:  it is not anymore simple and
educational-friendly, but it is rather a normal micro-kernel, ready for
production.  Its aim is mainly safety.

Minix can be found in `Github <https://github.com/minix3/minix>`_, as well!


Xv6
***

A rewrite of UNIX v6, using modern C and running on x86 platforms.
It is a simple kernel, useful for studying the internals of Unix and
operating-systems in general.

It compiles in a couple of seconds and is trivial to boot up in QEMU.

There is also an online book (stored locally) that describes the system,
and a book version with source code comments and line..

Some resources:
 o `Xv6 <http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html>`
 o Source code:  `<git://pdos.csail.mit.edu/xv6/xv6.git>`

 o `Manual <https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf`


Sortix
******

An alternative, lightweight, POSIX implemenation.

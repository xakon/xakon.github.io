### Books

 - [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation][pbr-book]
 - [Graphics Programming Black Book][black-book]:
   Michael Abrash's classic masterpiece on graphics.
   Even though the book is available online and for free, each chapter is
   distributed as a separate PDF file.  Alternatively, in a
   [Github project](https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book),
   we can build an EPUB, Mobi, or HTML version of the book.`
